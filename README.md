## Project Brief
The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information 
in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the 
features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts.

## MVP
- Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way.
- Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content.
